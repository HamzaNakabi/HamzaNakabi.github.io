CloudFox is an open-source command-line tool developed by Bishop Fox to assist penetration testers and security professionals in gaining situational awareness within unfamiliar cloud environments. Its primary goal is to automate the identification of exploitable attack paths in cloud infrastructures, thereby streamlining the assessment process.

## Key Features of CloudFox

- **Comprehensive Enumeration**: CloudFox offers a suite of commands tailored for cloud environment enumeration, including AWS and Azure, with planned support for GCP and Kubernetes.
- **Automated Analysis**: The tool automates the collection and analysis of cloud environment data, reducing the manual effort required during penetration tests.
- **Loot Files**: CloudFox generates "loot" files containing valuable information and commands that can be used for further investigation or exploitation.

## Installation

For macOS users, CloudFox can be installed using Homebrew:

```
brew install cloudfox
```

For other operating systems and installation methods, refer to the CloudFox GitHub repository.

## Usage Examples

Here are some practical examples of how CloudFox can be utilized during a cloud penetration test:

- **Enumerating AWS Resources**
To list all regions and the number of resources in an AWS account:

```
cloudfox aws enum-all --profile your-aws-profile
```
This command provides an overview of the AWS account's footprint across different regions.

- **Identifying Secrets in Environment Variables**

To search for secrets stored in Lambda environment variables:

```
cloudfox aws env-vars --profile your-aws-profile
```
This helps in identifying sensitive information that may be inadvertently exposed.

- **Assessing IAM Permissions**

To determine the actions a specific IAM principal can perform:

 ```
cloudfox aws iam-simulator --principal arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/example-user --profile your-aws-profile
 ```
This assists in evaluating the permissions assigned to users or roles.

 - **Discovering Publicly Accessible Endpoints**

To find publicly accessible endpoints in the cloud environment:

 ```
 cloudfox aws endpoints --profile your-aws-profile
 ```

 This identifies potential entry points that could be targeted from the internet.

## Practical Application Scenario

Consider a scenario where CloudFox is used to identify an RDS database with credentials stored in a Lambda environment variable:

***Extract Environment Variables***: Using the env-vars command, CloudFox retrieves environment variables from Lambda functions, uncovering RDS credentials.

***Locate the RDS Database***: The endpoints command reveals a publicly accessible RDS database.

***Establish a Connection***: With the obtained credentials, a connection to the RDS database is established, potentially accessing sensitive data.

***Evaluate Access Permissions***: The iam-simulator command identifies which users or roles have access to the Lambda function containing the RDS credentials, uncovering any unintended access.
