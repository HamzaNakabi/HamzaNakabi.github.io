CloudFox is an open-source command-line tool developed by Bishop Fox to assist penetration testers and security professionals in gaining situational awareness within unfamiliar cloud environments. Its primary goal is to automate the identification of exploitable attack paths in cloud infrastructures, thereby streamlining the assessment process.

## Key Features of CloudFox

- **Comprehensive Enumeration**: CloudFox offers a suite of commands tailored for cloud environment enumeration, including AWS and Azure, with planned support for GCP and Kubernetes.
- **Automated Analysis**: The tool automates the collection and analysis of cloud environment data, reducing the manual effort required during penetration tests.
- **Loot Files**: CloudFox generates "loot" files containing valuable information and commands that can be used for further investigation or exploitation.

## Installation

For macOS users, CloudFox can be installed using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install cloudfox
