## AI-Powered Anomaly Detection
QRadar's new **Cognitive Threat Analysis** engine uses transformer-based models to:
- Detect zero-day credential stuffing attacks (98% accuracy)
- Identify anomalous data exfiltration patterns
- Predict potential MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactic progression

### Custom Rule with ML Integration
```

when EventName MATCHES "Authentication Failure"
AND RiskScore() > 0.85
THEN escalateToThreatHuntingTeam("Suspected Brute Force")

```

## Cloud-Native Deployment
```

module "qradar_aws" {
source = "ibm/qradar/aws"
version = "2025.3"

vpc_id = "vpc-123456"
threat_intel_feeds = [
"aws:guardduty:findings",
"crowdstrike:falcon:indicators"
]

auto_scaling = {
min = 3
max = 12
metric = "EPS"
}
}

```
