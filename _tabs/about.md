## About Me

I am Hamza Nakabi and I live in France. My journey in the field of cybersecurity began over a decade ago, driven by my fascination with secure architectures, pentesting, and incident response. With a Master of Science degree focused on Cybersecurity from ENSEA, I have honed my skills in Cloud protection and automation.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work with some amazing companies. My roles have ranged from managing security configurations and integrating logs across diverse environments, to conducting penetration tests and deploying EDR and CSPM solutions. Each experience has enriched my expertise and passion for cybersecurity.

My professional interests lie in cloud security, DevSecOps, AWS, network analysis, SIEM, and security testing. I am fluent in English and a native speaker of French, which has allowed me to effectively communicate and collaborate with teams around the globe.

## About This Site

This site is my personal space to share insights and knowledge gained from my years in cybersecurity. It was created and is maintained using Jekyll, a static site generator that allows me to focus on content without getting bogged down by complex configurations.

For those curious, here's a brief overview of how I maintain this site:
- **Uses Jekyll 3.8**: For its simplicity and efficiency.
- **Hosted by GitHub via GitHub Pages**: Ensuring reliable and easy deployment.
- **Encrypted using Letâ€™s Encrypt**: For secure browsing.
- **Authored using Markdown on Visual Studio Code**: To streamline content creation.
- **Uses the Chirpy theme**: For a clean and modern look.

Feel free to explore the site and get in touch if you have any questions or collaboration ideas!
